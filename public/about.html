<h4>About my coding Experience:</h4>
   <p> I first came across with coding while I was still studying Finance in an Excel Programing class, using VBA. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I was impressed with how much you can increase the funcionalities installed in the program.
   <p> Learned how to create loops to save valuable time while doing analysis and decicion-making calculations in such important matters like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Forecasting sales scenarios taking into acount information from past forecasts. <li>Analyse the behaiviour of the consumers with many years info in severla Excel Sheets and Documents.</li> </ul>
        </ul>                 
          </li>
    <p>
 
   I saw for the first time, how this "Codeing" thing could really make a difference in 
   a lot of industry fields. That's why I decided that I needed to know a little more about it, that's why now I'm learning the very besics of Programing and Web Development.
